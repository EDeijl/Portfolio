Portfolio Erik Deijl
=======

What is it?
---
This is my personal portfolio webapp. It features a fully fledged webapi with authentication.
It will be able to generate my Resume on the fly.

Why?
---
Because I wanted to build something significant with Nodejs and Angularjs, and what better to promote your skills than building your portfolio with them?

How?
---

This webapp is build with Nodejs and Angularjs, it features SASS through Compass and generates HTML from Jade.
I started the project with the [angular fullstack generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack)

Can I use it?
----
As far as I'm concerned you can copy all of it. Just use the right licence.
